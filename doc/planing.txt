1. Hero Section (Minimal & Strong)
Aditya Kumawat  
Backend & Automation Engineer  

I build trading systems, automation tools, and scalable backend applications.


Buttons:

View Projects

GitHub

Contact

No crazy animation here. Maybe subtle fade-in.


Good Animations:

Fade-in on scroll

Smooth page transitions

Soft hover effects on project cards

Micro-interactions on buttons

Subtle cursor glow (optional)

Avoid:

Heavy Lottie animations

Autoplay videos

Background particles

Long intro animations

5️⃣ What Actually Makes a Portfolio Attractive

Not design.

These things:

✔ Real-world complex projects
✔ Architecture thinking
✔ Clean GitHub repos
✔ Clear documentation
✔ Performance optimization examples
✔ Problem-solving explanation

so the home page is simple some logo and in navigation some links for linkedin, github, resume, etc. my name in bold, tag line, description. and then action button for view projects and contact.

🔹 Project Block Structure (Very Important)

Each project should contain:

1️⃣ Project Name (Bold, clean)

Example:
Real-Time Trading Signal Distribution System

2️⃣ One-Line Identity Statement

What is it?

A scalable signal broadcasting system used to distribute trading signals in real time to subscribed users.

3️⃣ Tech Stack (Small, subtle)

Spring Boot • WebSocket • MQL5 • Telegram Bot API • MySQL

4️⃣ What Problem It Solves

1–2 short lines.

5️⃣ Engineering Depth (This is what makes you different)

Mention:

Architecture decisions

Latency handling

Subscription model

Security considerations

Deployment method

6️⃣ Buttons

View Code

Case Study (optional)

Live Demo (if exists)

Visual Feel of This Section

Background: Slight contrast from hero
Spacing: Generous
Cards: Soft shadow, subtle hover lift
Animation: Fade-in on scroll

Updated Structure (Much Stronger)

Hero
→ Selected Projects
→ Engineering Evolution (Timeline)
→ Skills
→ Experience
→ Contact

the timeline section:
The Real Question:

Is it valuable?

Yes — because you are not just a backend dev.

You:

Started with frontend

Moved into backend systems

Then into trading automation

Now moving into AI/ML

That shows intellectual progression.

That’s attractive.
How To Design It So It Feels Mature

Not like:
“Here is my journey from class 10.”

But like:
“Here is how my engineering thinking evolved.”

Recommended Timeline Structure

Title:

Engineering Evolution

or

From Interfaces to Intelligent Systems

That sounds powerful.

time line:
Frontend Foundations

Short, confident explanation.

Focus on:

Learning structure

UI systems

Early projects

Understanding user interaction

Expandable for early work.

This should feel like origin — not bragging.

Backend & System Thinking

Here you show growth into:

Java, Spring Boot

REST APIs

MySQL

API integrations

Performance awareness

Architecture decisions

This is where your engineering maturity begins.

Trading Systems & Real-Time Automation

(Trade Amplification Era)

This is important. This is your professional pivot.

Talk about:

MQL4 / MQL5 bots

Signal broadcasting systems

Subscription-based models

Telegram bots

Server-side automation

Latency and execution handling

Working with real market constraints

This section adds real weight.

This is where you stop being “developer learning things”
and become “developer building production systems.”

Moving Toward Intelligent Systems (AI/ML Direction)

Not “I learned AI”.

Instead:

Explain why AI became natural next step.

Talk about combining automation with intelligence.

Mention ELISA assistant.

Mention ML exploration.

Mention system + intelligence fusion.

This shows vision.

Companies love vision.

Very Important: Tone of Timeline

Not:

“I learned this, then I learned that.”

But:

“I started with UI thinking.
Then I became interested in system architecture.
While building trading infrastructure, I realized the power of automation at scale.
That naturally led me toward intelligent, AI-driven systems.”

See the difference?

That feels intentional.
Design Decision (Very Important)

For your personality and career style:

Best layout choice =

B) Left-aligned clean editorial timeline

Why?

Because you are not a designer.
You are an engineer.

Alternating left-right looks flashy.
Horizontal scroll looks gimmicky.
Full-screen Apple style is risky and heavy.

Left-aligned editorial timeline feels serious, readable, professional.

Add:

Thin vertical line

Subtle dot indicators

Smooth fade-in

Expand buttons for older work

Clean. Controlled. Confident.

One More Important Strategic Decision

Timeline entries should not repeat full project details.

Projects section = technical proof.

Timeline = evolution narrative.

Don’t duplicate content.
Just reference it.

Example:

“During this period, I built real-time signal systems and automated trading infrastructure (see selected projects).”

That creates internal linking.

Very professional touch.

skills section:
Recommended Layout Style

Clean section title:

Capabilities

or

Technical Expertise

Then divide into 4–5 categories.

No random mixing.

Suggested Categories For You
1️⃣ Backend & APIs

Java
Spring Boot
REST APIs
Jakarta
MySQL
WebSocket

Short subtext:

Designing scalable backend systems and API-driven architectures.

2️⃣ Trading & Automation

MQL4
MQL5
Pine Script
Signal Broadcasting Systems
Telegram Bot Integration

Subtext:

Building automated trading logic and real-time signal infrastructure.

This is your niche strength. Make it visible.

3️⃣ AI & Intelligent Systems

Python
Machine Learning (learning phase)
AI Assistant Architecture
Data Processing

Subtext:

Transitioning toward intelligent, decision-driven systems.

Notice:
You’re not overselling AI.
You’re positioning growth.

That’s mature.

4️⃣ Systems & Tools

Linux
Git
GitHub
VS Code
Eclipse

Subtext:

Development workflow and deployment environment familiarity.

How It Should Visually Appear

Option 1 (Recommended for You):

Text-first, minimal grid.

Each category:

Bold title

Short description

Skills listed cleanly below

No massive colorful logos.

Maybe small monochrome icons if you really want.

What NOT To Do

❌ 40 colorful logos floating
❌ Skill bars like “Java 95%”
❌ 5-star rating system
❌ Big rotating tech stack animation

Those scream beginner.

Animation Advice

Keep it subtle:

Fade in category blocks

Slight hover elevation

Soft highlight when hovered

Maybe smooth underline animation

No bouncing logos.
No rotating cubes.
No particle effects.

Very Important Strategic Detail

Your skills section should visually support your direction shift.

Meaning:

Backend & Trading categories should feel strong.
AI category should feel intentional but growing.

That tells a hiring manager:
“He has depth, and he has direction.”

experience section:
First Rule for Experience Section

Experience is not a diary.
It is a professional record of impact and capability.

We frame:

What you worked on

What you built

What you explored

What technical depth you reached

What constraints you faced

We do NOT frame:

Company politics

Emotional disappointment

“They didn’t support me”

We turn constraints into engineering reality.

How Experience Section Should Look

Title:

Professional Experience

Clean layout.
Company name bold.
Role + Duration.
Then impact-focused bullets.

Not paragraph storytelling.

Experience Entry Structure

For each company:

Company Name
Role
Duration

Then:

What you built

What technologies used

What problems tackled

What scale handled

What constraints managed

Now Let’s Structure Qubitron Labs Properly

What you did is not “failed project.”

It is:

Research & ML experimentation under infrastructure constraints.

Here’s how it should be framed:

Qubitron Labs

AI Research & Trading Systems Developer
(4 Months)

Worked on research-driven AI models for trading strategy generation and market prediction.

Key Contributions:

Designed a level-based pipeline to process OHLC data and generate potential trade opportunity signals.

Engineered feature sets using:

TA-Lib indicators

Custom support/resistance logic

SMA, EMA (200+ variations)

Percentage and BPS transformations

Normalized static and dynamic features

Processed and structured ~57 crore rows of market data for model experimentation.

Implemented decision tree models for strategy discovery.

Experimented with XGBoost for improved predictive modeling.

Prepared 27GB dataset of chart images + next-move labels for visual model fine-tuning (Qwen 3VL).

Designed data pipelines for model training and fine-tuning under limited GPU infrastructure.

Notice what changed?

We didn’t say:
“They didn’t give GPU.”

We said:
“Designed under limited GPU infrastructure.”

That sounds mature.

Now Important Question

Should we show incomplete projects?

Yes — if:

They show technical depth

They show scale

They show experimentation

No — if:

They are half-built CRUD apps

Your ML research absolutely deserves space.

It shows:

Data engineering

Feature engineering

Model experimentation

Infrastructure awareness

Real constraints of ML training

That’s valuable.

Now Let’s Structure Trade Amplification

That one should show:

Production systems

Real trading bots

Signal distribution

Subscription systems

Server development

That is your strong real-world proof.

Tone of Experience Section

Professional.
Technical.
Measured.
Not defensive.
Not emotional.

One Strategic Suggestion

For Qubitron role, you can add a small line at end:

Exposure to large-scale data processing and model infrastructure limitations strengthened my understanding of ML system deployment requirements.

That turns unfinished work into growth.
The Right Visual Direction For Your Experience Section

For you, the best approach is:

Left-aligned professional timeline style (but not the same as your evolution timeline).

Important:
It should NOT look identical to your “Engineering Evolution” timeline.

We differentiate:

Evolution Timeline = narrative storytelling

Experience Section = professional record
Visual Hierarchy (Very Important)

Company Name → Bold, larger font
Role → Medium weight
Duration → Light, subtle
Bullets → Clean and tight

This creates visual authority.

Should It Be Timeline With Line & Dots?

No.

You already have a timeline in the Evolution section.

If you repeat timeline design here, it feels redundant and busy.

Experience should feel:

Corporate
Stable
Structured
Trustworthy

Not narrative.

Background Styling Suggestion

If hero is light:

Experience section can have:
Very subtle off-white or light gray background to separate it.

If dark theme:

Slightly elevated cards with soft shadow or glow.

But no heavy gradients.
No animated backgrounds.

Animation Style

Very minimal:

Fade-in when entering viewport

Expand animation smooth (height transition)

Slight hover lift on cards

No slide from left/right.
No dramatic motion.
No bounce.

Experience section should feel grounded.

Should We Add Company Logos?

Small, monochrome version — optional.

But:

Do not make logos dominate.

Text should dominate.

Now Let’s Visually Compare Sections

Hero → Minimal
Projects → Premium case-study cards
Evolution → Editorial vertical line storytelling
Skills → Structured categorized grid
Experience → Clean professional card blocks

Each section has its own personality.

That makes the whole site feel designed — not repetitive.

For You Specifically

Your Qubitron ML work is technically heavy.

So I strongly recommend:

Hybrid UI:

Clean summary bullets

“View Technical Details” expandable section

Inside expansion you can show:

Pipeline architecture steps

Data size handled

Model experimentation

Constraints

This will impress engineers deeply.

Important Strategic Advice

Experience section is not about emotion.
It’s about responsibility and scale.

So visually:
Less design.
More clarity.

contact section:
Purpose of Contact Section

Not:
“Here’s my email.”

But:

👉 Give recruiters the easiest possible way to reach you.
👉 Reinforce your direction.
👉 End with confidence.

Where It Should Appear

Last section.

After Experience.

Because:

Proof → Growth → Capability → Professional Record → Action

That flow feels complete.

What It Should Contain

Keep it minimal but intentional.

Section Title:

Let’s Build Something Meaningful
or
Let’s Connect
or
Open to Opportunities

For you, something slightly forward-looking works well.

Structure
1️⃣ Short Closing Statement (2–3 lines max)

Example structure:

What you're currently focused on

What kind of opportunities you're open to

A confident closing tone

Not long.
Not emotional.
Not dramatic.

2️⃣ Contact Options

Must include:

Email (clickable)

LinkedIn

GitHub

Resume download

Optional:

Phone (only if you want it public)

Telegram (since you're trading-system oriented — this could be interesting but optional)

3️⃣ CTA Button

One strong button:

“Get in Touch”
or

“Start a Conversation”

Clean, bold, centered.

UI Design Recommendation (Very Important)

Do NOT make a giant form.

No 7-field contact form.
No complex validation UI.
No heavy animation.

Best options:

Option A (Recommended):

Minimal centered layout

Big heading
Short text
Two buttons
Email shown

Very Apple-like.

Option B:

Two-column layout

Left:
Message

Right:
Contact links + icons

Still clean.

Should You Add a Contact Form?

Only if:

It’s simple (Name + Email + Message)

It works reliably

It doesn't look outdated

But honestly?

For developer portfolios:
Direct email + LinkedIn works better.

Recruiters prefer LinkedIn DM.

Animation Style

Keep it calm.

Subtle fade-in.
Button hover glow.
That’s it.

End the page in a stable, confident tone.

One Advanced Touch (Optional but Powerful)

Below contact buttons, a subtle line:

Currently focused on building intelligent backend systems integrating AI-driven decision making.

That reinforces your direction one last time.
