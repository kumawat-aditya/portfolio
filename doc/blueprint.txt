# 🎨 Global Design System

**Vibe:** Minimal, Architectural, “Apple-esque” but engineered for developers.
**Typography:** Clean Sans-Serif (Inter, Geist, Roboto).
**Color Palette:** Monochrome (Black/White/Grays) + one subtle accent (deep tech blue or teal) for buttons/links.
**Sequence:**

**Hero → Selected Projects → Engineering Evolution → Capabilities (Skills) → Professional Experience → Contact**

# Section 1: Hero (The Hook)

**Goal:** Instant clarity. No fluff.

**Layout:** Center-aligned or broad Left-aligned.

**Content:**

* Name: **Aditya Kumawat** (Bold, Large)
* Title: Backend & Automation Engineer (Medium weight)
* Tagline: *“I build trading systems, automation tools, and scalable backend applications.”*
* Action Buttons:

  * **[View Projects]** – solid primary CTA
  * **[GitHub]** – outline or icon
  * **[Contact]** – simple text or button

**Animation:**

* Text staggered fade-in (Name → Title → Tagline)
* No heavy background particles

# Section 2: Selected Projects (The Proof)

**Goal:** Show technical depth, not “clones or demos.”

**Layout:** Vertical stack of cards, generous whitespace.
**Visual Style:** Soft-shadow cards, slight contrast.

**Card Structure (per project):**

* **Project Name:** Real-Time Trading Signal Distribution System
* **Identity:** “A scalable signal broadcasting system used to distribute trading signals in real time.”
* **Tech Stack:** Spring Boot • WebSocket • MQL5 • Telegram Bot API
* **Depth:** Bullet points highlighting architecture, latency handling, security, scalability
* **Action:** [View Code] [Live Demo/Case Study]

**Animation:** Fade-in + slight upward motion on scroll; hover lifts card 2–4px with shadow depth.

# Section 3: Engineering Evolution (The Narrative)

**Goal:** Show intentional growth from frontend → backend → trading → AI/ML.

**Layout:** Left-aligned editorial timeline with vertical line + subtle dot markers.
**Title:** *“From Interfaces to Intelligent Systems”*

**Content Blocks:**

* **Frontend Foundations:** UI systems, layouts, user interaction
* **Backend & System Thinking:** Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, architecture
* **Trading Systems (Trade Amplification Era):** MQL5, real-time automation, signal distribution
* **Moving Toward Intelligent Systems:** Automation + AI/ML (ELISA, Qwen, research pipelines)

**Animation:**

* Vertical line draws as you scroll
* Text fades in from right
* No distracting motion

---

# Section 4: Capabilities (Skills)

**Goal:** Show competence and niche focus.

**Layout:** Clean 2x2 grid, text-first.

**Title:** *Technical Expertise*

**Grid Content:**

* **Backend & APIs:** Java, Spring Boot, WebSocket – *Designing scalable backend systems*
* **Trading & Automation:** MQL5, signal broadcasting – *Automated trading logic & real-time pipelines*
* **AI & Intelligent Systems:** Python, ML, data processing – *Transitioning toward intelligent systems*
* **Systems & Tools:** Linux, Git, Docker – *Development workflow & deployment*

**Animation:** Fade-in per category, subtle hover highlight.

# Section 5: Professional Experience (The Record)

**Goal:** Corporate trust + technical responsibility.

**Layout:** Full-width card blocks, distinct from timeline.

**Visual Hierarchy:**

* **Company Name (Bold):** Qubitron Labs / Trade Amplification
* **Role:** AI Research & Trading Systems Developer
* **Duration:** Right-aligned/subtle below role

**Key Features:**

* Summary bullets (3–4 max)
* Expandable “View Technical Details” showing deep engineering work (57 crore rows, pipeline, feature engineering, models, GPU constraints)

**Animation:**

* Fade-in on scroll
* Smooth accordion expansion

**Constraint Re-framing:**

> “Designed data pipelines for model training and fine-tuning under limited GPU infrastructure.”

---

# Section 6: Contact (The Closing)

**Goal:** Low-friction connection.

**Layout:** Minimal, centered

**Title:** *“Let’s Build Something Meaningful”*
**Copy:** *“Currently focused on building intelligent backend systems integrating AI-driven decision making.”*

**Actions:**

* Big button: [email@address.com](mailto:email@address.com)
* Row of icons: LinkedIn | GitHub | Resume

**Animation:** Subtle pulse on hover

# ⚡ Summary of Best Practices

* Replace “Skills” with **Technical Expertise**
* Timeline: *From Interfaces to Intelligent Systems*
* Experience framing: focus on **responsibility & depth**, not company trust issues
* Closing: highlight AI/backend trajectory
* Animations: subtle, smooth, fade-in, no heavy Lottie files or skill bars
* Visual hierarchy: minimal, architectural, professional, “Apple-esque”

**Design Philosophy:**

> Hero → Projects → Evolution → Skills → Experience → Contact
> Show who you are → what you can do → how you grew → your capabilities → proof → opportunity to connect
